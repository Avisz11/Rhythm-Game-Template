# Rhythm-Game-Template
A rhythm game template for godot similar to games such as osu mania and firday night funkin.


<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>It's really simple. Just go through the code and you'll know how it works.
Remember to adjust your Input Map for the amount of keys and edit the "spawn_positions" array for the amount of keys. Say for 4 keys put 4 positions
(which are ofcourse on the x axis). This is a really simple system that i made so anyone can start prototyping a rhythm game fast. Thank you!</p>
